 * Build profile for django-require.

 * This supports all the normal configuration available to a r.js build profile. The only gotchas are:
 *
 *   - 'baseUrl' will be overidden by django-require during the build process.
 *   - 'appDir' will be overidden by django-require during the build process.
 *   - 'dir' will be overidden by django-require during the build process.
